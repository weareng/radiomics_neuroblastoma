    "### Methods\n",
    "131 radiomic features were extracted with pyradiomics.\n",
    "Ideally should be feature selected and feature dimensionality reduced, but I found that it results in poorer results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "Out of logistic regression, random forest and support vector machines, logistic regression performed the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "- My feature selection does not seem to be conferring any additional advantage to my accuracy. (Not sure if my feature selection was done correctly.)\n",
    "- I would want to continue to test try various methods of feature selection (e.g., filter, wrapper, embedded methods) and dimensionality reduction, based on principles from \"Radiomics and Its Feature Selection: A Review\" by Wenchao Zhang. \n",
    "- Would dimensionality reduciton in the context of radiomics negatively affect the interpretability of my results?\n",
    "- I would want to use GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters. \n",
    "- I would want to use cross validation for train test split. This will require sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline() to fit and transform the training data."
